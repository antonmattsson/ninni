# Ninni

Ninni is a data visualization web app designed for representing results from scientific studies.

The main focus is in representing effects of variables (e.g. drugs) or association between variables (e.g. drug interaction) on another variable (e.g. mortality, risk of arrhytmia)

Ninni uses [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com). Ninni's data is stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
