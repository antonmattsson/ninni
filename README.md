# Ninni

Ninni is a data visualization web app designed for representing results from scientific studies.

The main focus is in representing effects (odds-ratio, fold change or correlation) of variables (e.g. drugs) or association between variables (e.g. drug interaction) on another variable (e.g. mortality, risk of arrhytmia)

Ninni uses [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com). Ninni's data is stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
