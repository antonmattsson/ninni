
PREREQUISITE SOFTWARE

PostgreSQL
To set up Ninni's database you need to install PostgreSQL (we are using version 9.2.18 for Red Hat family Linux).


Python

The import script to Ninni's database was written in Python 3.5.3 and requires the psycopg2 library (v2.7.1) to connect to a postgreSQL database.
You can install these prerequisites manually or use the conda environment file in the src folder.
If you dont have conda installed, you can get it from here: https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html.
Once you have conda, you can install the ninni environment using src/ninni_env.json:
$ conda env create -n ninni_env â€“f ninni_env.json
The correct versions of all libraries used by Ninni will be installed.


R

The Shiny web app uses R 3.3.3. You can install all the required R packages with src/install.packages.R script.
Unfortunately it is not possible to install R 3.3.3 nor these packages through conda.



SETUP

Database

Set up a PostgreSQL database on your server and add the connection information to a following files:
src/database_import.config
www/database_www.config

You can see the correct form from example files src/database_import.config-TEMPLATE and www/database_www.config-TEMPLATE

The reason for having two files is that in our case we have two users for the database. One has both reading and writing permissions
and is used by the import script. The other has only reading permissions and is used by the Shiny application.

By default, the import script drops and recreates the database schema in the beginning of every import. Thus, there is no need to create any
tables prior to import of data, but the schema will be created automatically.

Shiny app

Once you have imported data into your database and added connection information you can run the Shiny application from R console with the command:
shiny::runApp("path/to/ninni/www")
