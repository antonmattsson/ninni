FEATURES

Terminology

LABEL	Short internal identificator for items. Consist of alphanumeric characters and _. Example: DATASET_1
DESCRIPTION	Free text description for the item. Can contain special characters. Example: Dataset comparing weight (kg) and height (cm).


FOR ADMINS

1. Import data

Datasets
=======
- The main container unit of the data. 
* ID
* LABEL (Example: DRUG_STUDY_1)
* DESCRIPTION (Example: "Drug interaction study, using mortality as outcome")
* VARNUM (Enumeration of number of variables in associations, either 1 or 2)
* EFFECT_TYPE (Enumeration of different effect types, e.g. "OR", "FC", "CORRELATION")

DatasetMetaData
===============
- Meta-data further descriping the dataset. Meta-data are "tags" that can be used to group different datasets, e.g. "Men", "Drugs", "Diabetes"
- Dataset can be linked to several meta-data
* ID
* LABEL (Example: T2D)
* DESCRIPTION (Example: "Type 2 Diabetes related study")

DatasetToMetaData
=================
* ID
* DATASET_ID
* DATASETMETADATA_ID

Associations
===========
- Associations are the actual numerical data.
- Association must be linked to a dataset
* ID
* N (Number of observations the association is based on)
* EFFECT (Size of the effect (e.g. Odds ratio, correlation coefficient))
* P (Statistical significance (p-value))
* P_FDR (Statistical significance (p-value) adjusted for multiple comparisons)
* EFFECT_L95 (95% lower confidence interval for the effect, NOT REQUIRED)
* EFFECT_U95 (95% upper confidence interval for the effect, NOT REQUIRED)
* DATASET_ID

Variables
========
- Variables are linked to associations via AssociationToVariable table
* ID
* LABEL (Example: WEIGHT)
* DESCRIPTION (Example: "Weight (kg)")

AssociationToVariable
* ID
* ASSOCIATION_ID
* VARIABLE_ID

Data import flow

- User provides name for the database schema (e.g. as a command line parameter), allowing storing several versions of the whole database

- User provides a list of datasets, e.g. tab-delimited text file: datasets.txt

DATASET_FILENAME	VARIABLES_FILENAME	LABEL	DESCRIPTION	VARNUM	EFFECT_TYPE	METADATA_LABELS
study1.txt	study1_variables.txt	DRUG_STUDY1	Drug interaction study, using mortality as outcome	2	OR	DRUG_INTERACTION;MALES;T2D

- User provides a file describing meta-data: metadata.txt

LABEL	DESCRIPTION
DRUG_INTERACTION	Drug interaction study
MALE	Only males
T2D	Type 2 Diabetes

- User can provide files with the variable descriptions, filenames are the same as in datasets.txt VARIABLES_FILENAME, e.g. study1_variables.txt
- If this file is not specified for the dataset, variable description is set to be the same as the variable label.

LABEL	DESCRIPTION
ABCD	Best known gene to man-kind
TP53	Cancer gene

- User provides files with the associations, filenames are the same as in datasets.txt DATASET_FILENAME column, e.g. study1.txt

VARIABLE1_LABEL	VARIABLE2_LABEL	EFFECT	EFFECT_L95	EFFECT_U95	N	P	P_FDR
ABCD	TP53	8	5	10	100	0.01	1

All the data is imported in the database as a single bulk.
