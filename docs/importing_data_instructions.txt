Data import flow

- User provides a list of datasets in a tab-delimited text file: e.g. datasets.txt

DATASET_FILENAME	VARIABLES_FILENAME	LABEL	DESCRIPTION	VARNUM	EFFECT_TYPE	METADATA_LABELS
study1.csv	study1_variables.txt	DRUG_STUDY1	Drug interaction study, using mortality as outcome	2	OR	DRUG_INTERACTION;MALES;T2D

- User provides a file describing meta-data: metadata.txt

LABEL	DESCRIPTION
DRUG_INTERACTION	Drug interaction study
MALE	Only males
T2D	Type 2 Diabetes

- User can provide files with the variable descriptions, filenames are the same as in datasets.txt VARIABLES_FILENAME, e.g. study1_variables.txt
- If this file is not specified for the dataset, variable description is set to be the same as the variable label.

LABEL	DESCRIPTION
ABCD	Best known gene to man-kind
TP53	Cancer gene

- User provides CSV files with the associations, filenames are the same as in datasets.txt DATASET_FILENAME column, e.g. study1.csv

VARIABLE1_LABEL	VARIABLE2_LABEL	EFFECT	EFFECT_L95	EFFECT_U95	N	P	P_FDR
ABCD	TP53	8	5	10	100	0.01	1

All the data is imported in the database as a single bulk.


Importing is done using import_data.py script.

-df gives the dataset file
-mdf is for the metadata file (optional)

Example: python src/import_data.py -df data/datasets.txt -mdf data/metadata.txt
