Using the importing_data_instructions file, import all the datasets in the /data repository into Ninni's database.

- All the .csv files are already in the correct format, so the sections 1 and 2 of the instructions are already done.

- The datasets.txt file already exists, but it is missing one row:
	- the dataset is in ninni_results_event_ryhapv_single.csv
	- the corresponding variable information is in ninni_variables_event_ryhapv_single.csv
	- the dataset label should be EVENT_RYHA_SINGLE
	- the description should be "Effect of individual drugs to risk of arrhytmia"
	- the number of variables is 1
	- the effect type is odds-ratio (OR)
	- there should be only one metadata tag associated: ARRHYTMIA

- The metadata.txt file also exists, but is missing one row
	- ARRHYTMIA should have description: The risk of arrhytmia
